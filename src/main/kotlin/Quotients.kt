/*
In this project, I learned that there are many different GUIs for version control, one being GitKraken. I understood
that a branch allows you to create a separate version of the repository so you can work on it (by creating commits)
before merging it back into the file. This lets you keep track of the different versions of your project and avoid
making unwanted changes.
